# Employee Manager RPC
RPC layer for the Employee Manager application (C Language)

----

#### Setup
1. First start by installing the necessary dependencies.

###### Dependencies
  * `libserc` - https://github.com/nickkhall/libserc.git
  * `libdbsqlc` - https://github.com/nickkhall/libdbsqlc.git
  * `libsockc` - https://github.com/nickkhall/libsockc.git

2. After the dependencies are cloned, you have two options:

  -- **MANUAL**: Navigate to each repository, and run `make`. This should produce a binary executable in the repository's root `bin` directory with the file named as the repository's name.

  -- **AUTOMATIC**: Navigate to the premade script at `https://gist.github.com/nickkhall/0af1d83b34b4b072d710db61fc385bb3` and run it.
> **NOTE**: I am not responsible for what happens to your property as a result of running this script. The code is NOT gauranteed to be 100% stable, so run at your own risk.
